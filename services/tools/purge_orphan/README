This tool is used for orphan service instances & bindings related issues. Currently, it can make request to service gateway to check orphans and purge orphans.

This tool reads options from a config file. Use "-c" to specify the config file; the default config file is "config/default.yml".

The service gateway can be configured to check orphan periodically. It's disabled by default, however. It also can be run on demand by this command:
    bin/purge_orphan.rb -k
This command will scan for orphans and write the updated status to varz of the service gateway and nodes.

The report of varz in json format can be input as the request to purge the orphans. Run command like this:
    bin/purge_orphan.rb sample.json
