The backup manager manages backups.  Currently, its only job is
rotation: it inspects the backup directory to prune old backups.

The backup manager can be run in two modes:

 - it can do its work once and then exit [the default]; or

 - it can spawn a daemon process that periodically wakes up and does
   its work

The backup manager is configured by config/backup_manager.yaml.

The main entry point is
"core/services/backup/manager/bin/backup_manager".  Here's how to run
it:
  Usage: backup_manager [options]
      -c, --config [ARG]               Configuration File
      -d, --[no-]daemon                Run as a daemon
      -h, --help                       Help
